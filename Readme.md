# Welcome to FPLFOX

## A (flight simulator) flight planning software as web app.

> This work is based on a reimplementation of FPLFOX legacy Java/Swing App, which was written in the early 2010s purely for private usage.

The goals of this software are:

- Visually and textually plan your simulator flights
- Import and export flight plans
- Optimize flight plans
